# This file is used to configure the git source
# of protobuf. 
# 
# The file should only contain one line that directs
# the git repository (contains '.git' suffix). e.g.:
# https://github.com/YYHEggEgg/mihomo-protos.git
# Only the first line takes effect.
# 
# Notice that it does not need to be enabled if you
# don't have problem accessing GitHub; it'll probably
# affect the build interval.
