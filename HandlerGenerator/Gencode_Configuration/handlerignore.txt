# This is the Protoshift Handlers ignore file.
# 
# If some proto need special work, please add
# them to the file, one name per line.
# 
# e.g. Write like this:
# UnionCmd
# 
# After running the program, you may write your
# code based on files with the same name
# in ProtoshiftHandlers/SpecialHandlers.
# (e.g. HandlerUnionCmd.cs)
# 
# There'll be the generated code, but they won't
# change since the next time running build.
