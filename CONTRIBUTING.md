# Contributing 

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project. If you have any further questions please [create an issue](https://github.com/YYHEggEgg/csharp-Protoshift/issues/new/choose) or ask in [the Discord server](https://discord.gg/3XkT93zsNy).

- Only fix/add the functionality in question OR address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.

**Do not make a pull request to merge into branch `main`. Use the development branch instead.**

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any custom dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md and wiki with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Write with detail on your pull request description what you have committed, to make it easier for the collaborators to make a changelog.
